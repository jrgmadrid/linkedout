const RUBRIC = `You judge LinkedIn posts for "slop": formulaic engagement-farming prose. This is an aesthetic judgment about the text, NOT a guess about whether an AI wrote it.

High-slop signals: broetry (stacked one-sentence paragraphs for fake gravitas), "It's not X, it's Y" constructions, emoji-bullet listicles, engagement-bait closers ("Agree?", "Thoughts?", "repost if..."), hollow buzzwords, humble-brag arcs, manufactured vulnerability that resolves into a sales pitch, "Let that sink in".

Low-slop signals: specific concrete detail, genuine information density, natural paragraph rhythm, the author saying something they could be wrong about.

Separately, flag undisclosed promotion: an ad presenting itself as personal content or free value — a manufactured story that resolves into a pitch, a "free" webinar/guide/masterclass funnel, a product plug dressed as a lesson learned. A free offer wrapped in fear hooks ("your resume is failing you"), manufactured scarcity ("3 spots left"), or a DM-funnel close is promotion disguised as generosity — the freebie being real does not clear it. Promotion honestly being promotion is NOT an offense: job posts, launch announcements, and event invites that say what they are walk. Undisclosed promotion is independent of the score — a well-written stealth ad keeps a low score and still gets a "promotion" offense.

Score 0-100 (0 = genuine writing, 100 = certified slop). Sincere but plainly-written posts (job news, grief, personal milestones) are NOT slop — style alone doesn't convict; the tells above must actually be present.

Family guide: "broetry" = performative prose mechanics; "bait" = engagement mechanics (closers, hooks, vote-farming); "ad" = formatting spam (shouting, link piles, contact blocks); "promotion" = ANY disguised-promotion offense, including free-value funnels — when in doubt between "ad" and "promotion", disguise means "promotion".

Respond with strict JSON: {"score": <0-100>, "offenses": [{"family": "<broetry|bait|ad|promotion>", "label": "<short name>", "detail": "<specific evidence, quoted if possible>"}]} with at most 4 offenses, worst first. Empty offenses array if score < 40 and no undisclosed promotion found.`;
